# GroupieXamarin

Xamarin bindings library for the [groupie](https://github.com/lisawray/groupie) library.

> Groupie is a simple, flexible library for complex RecyclerView layouts.

**Currently this library supports only groupie 2.1.0** because groupie 2.2.0 or later has been migrated to AndroidX but task to migrate Xamarin.Android bindings to AndroidX seems to be in progress. So, I can not binding latest library yet because package name does not match. (If you know how to bind, please let me know.)
